# GreenHouse Tender
 Backyard greenhouse climate and soil monitor and interface.

This document outlines the development of a weather forecasting application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for any specified location. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the city name provided by the user. The implementation involves setting up an Admin interface to capture user input, sending an automated request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified city name, and displaying the retrieved weather information, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, then using this data to inform a greenhouse climate monitoring application so that interior conditions will automatically be adjusted to maintain optimal climate conditions for plant growth.
