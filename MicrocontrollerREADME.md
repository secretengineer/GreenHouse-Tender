### Arduino-based Solution for controlling the Relay

For integrating the SHT30 sensor and an Adafruit FeatherWing with a power relay using an Arduino-based platform:

1. The SHT30 sensor communicates via I2C protocol, which is widely supported by Arduinos.
2. Many Arduino boards have built-in I2C capabilities.
3. The Adafruit FeatherWing with a power relay module is compatible with various Arduino boards.

Here are some suitable options:

### 1. Arduino Uno

The Arduino Uno is a popular choice for beginners and hobbyists. It has 14 digital I/O pins, including several PWM pins, which should be sufficient for connecting the SHT30 sensor and the relay.

### 2. Arduino Mega

If you need more I/O pins or want to expand your project, the Arduino Mega offers 54 digital I/O pins, making it ideal for more complex setups.

### 3. Arduino Due

For higher performance requirements, the Arduino Due features a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 processor, which could handle more demanding tasks if needed in the future.

To adapt the code for an Arduino:

1. Replace `RPi.GPIO` with the appropriate Arduino library for GPIO control.
2. Use the Wire library for I2C communication instead of `smbus2`.
3. Adjust the pin assignments according to your chosen Arduino board's pinout.

Install the necessary libraries (`Adafruit_SHT30`) in your Arduino IDE before uploading the sketch to your chosen microcontroller board.

This adaptation will allow you to integrate the SHT30 sensor and the Adafruit FeatherWing with a power relay on an Arduino-based system, providing similar functionality to the original Raspberry Pi implementation.
